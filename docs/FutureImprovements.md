# Future Improvements

Given time constraints, I wasn't able to get to these action items. Here is a list of things I would have liked to implement or would implement in the future.

1. Caching layer to cache repeated calls for multiple benefits (performance, better throughput, less network latency)
   a. Design caching strategy to support blocks needing multiple confirmations before caching.  
   b. WAs goign to use Scaffeine if I had more time
2. Unit tests
3. Better authentication layer to gate access - use Project secret, JWT tokens, etc.
4. Swagger or OpenApi spec equivalent for Json-RPC apis.
5. More robust web framework or testing framework with more support for blockchain specific applications.
